        <h2>For this section, i will tell about my experience of online learning.</h2><br>
        <h2>The main challenge for me was to maintain the same levels of discipline in my studies even though I was at home. When you're stuck at home with your entire family, it's easy to become distracted.</h2><br>
    	<h2>Second, the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has been an additional challenge. There have been times when motivation and morale have been low during this period. This is due, in part, to the virus's devastating implications and effects on thousands of people. Fortunately, i survived this semester succesfully despite the challenges.</h2><br>
    	<h2>Alhamdulilah. However, I'm still sad because I won't be able to attend a pyshical class with my beloved friends and lecturers. I miss my campus and hostel terribly. I'm hoping that this pandemic will be over soon. </h2><br>
